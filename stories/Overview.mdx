# Design tokens

Canada.ca Design Tokens are the fundamental visual design attributes of our design system, abstracted into reusable variables which are used to create consistent experiences. Each token stores a choice (like a reusable color), or a choice applied to a context (that color applied to a background or text). The system automates the transformation of tokens (stored in YAML) into platform specific formats for use directly in our projects.

## How to use design tokens

Design Tokens are the smallest building blocks of Canada.ca's Design System and represent values such as color, spacing, typography. Conceptually, Design Tokens are technology agnostic and are used instead of hard-coded values to enable:

- common language between designers and developers
- consistency across the Government of Canada products
- flexibility
- maintainability

To advocate a common language between designers and developers Design Tokens are integrated to work seamlessly in our design platform (e.g. Figma) and component library. By using Design Tokens instead of hard-coded values we are able to change values in a single place without having to update all the usages manually.

## Design Token Anatomy

Each design token has a name, a value, optionally a description containing usage guidelines and design intentions, and a status indicating whether the design token is deprecated, embraced, in evaluation or endured.

Here is an example of a color design token:

<div class="sb-unstyled">
  <div>
    <div>
      <div></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span
        data-size="size-300"
        data-color="color-neutral-700">
        color-primary-700
        <span data-testid="tag"
          aria-label="Embrace"
          role="listitem"
        >
          <span class="">Embrace</span>
        </span>
      </span>
      <span
        data-size="size-200"
        data-color="color-gray-700">
        #006EEB
      </span>
      <span
        data-size="size-200"
        data-color="color-neutral-700">
        Call to action color used for primary buttons and links. Reserve usages
        to elements with interactions like clickable items and not for plain
        text.
      </span>
      <div>
        <span
          data-size="size-200"
          data-color="color-gray-700">
          Contrast Ratio: 4.74:1
        </span>
        <svg
          width="16px"
          height="16px"
          viewBox="0 0 24 24">
          <g transform="rotate(0 12 12)">
            <g
              stroke="none"
              stroke-width="1"
              fill="none"
              fill-rule="evenodd"
              data-icon-type="fill"
            >
              <path
                d="M16.5,15 L16.5,18 L7.5,18 L7.5,15 L16.5,15 Z M16.5,3 L16.5,15 L13.5,15 L13.5,3 L16.5,3 Z"
                transform="rotate(45 12 10.5)"
              ></path>
            </g>
          </g>
        </svg>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
